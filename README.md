This project demonstrates the use of change detection strategies and hierarchical dependency injection in Angular.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:
- **Node.js** (version 18.13.0 recommended)
- **Yarn** (you can install it globally with npm: `npm install --global yarn`)

## Installation

1. **Install the project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   yarn install
2. **To run the application locally, use the following command**:
